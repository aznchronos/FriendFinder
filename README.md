## FriendFinder
This is a survey that determines which "The Hangover" character would be your best friend.

## Motivation
I wanted to have some experience with understanding relational management in a quick and simple way using Node, SQL and Express, so I thought it'd be fun to make it The Hangover themed.

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -

[![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/akashnimare/foco?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/akashnimare/foco/branch/master)

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

## Screenshots

The homescreen is very simple, upfront, and allows the user to try out the survey and check out the reasoning behind the code.

#### Survey Page

The survey page is equally as simple. Each individual question is already available for display to the user, while making sure there's no empty answers.
